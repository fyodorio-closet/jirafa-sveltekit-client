# Jirafa SvelteKit application

## The goal

Build a project management application (consider it to be something like the [Atlassian's Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)) with UI/UX closely resembling the [Slack](https://slack.com)'s UI/UX. The final goal is not only to have the well-working tool itself, but also get [myself](https://github.com/fyodorio) familiar with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

## Getting started
