# Jirafa SvelteKit application

## The goal

Build a project management application (consider it to be something like the [Atlassian's Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)) with UI/UX closely resembling the [Slack](https://slack.com)'s UI/UX. The final goal is not only to have the well-working tool itself, but also to get familiar with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), and the idea of [transitional apps](https://twitter.com/hashtag/transitionalapps) in general.

This application is built as a pet project in a free time, so the pace of development is quite slow. As some kind of MVP is build, the Releases section will be turned on with the first release tagged.
